When there is live data feed use the Clock to find the Clock time zone location matching     You can populate the Clock with all labels to find "B" (see Clock instructions below).
     Chances are the labels needed are displayed.  If "B" shows in the "London" label
     things are not so clear because London time is GMT during the non-DST time of the year
     (winter in northern hemisphere).  During that time we can not tell from the  if the
     broker server is on GMT or on London time all year.  Call your broker to find out.

     You now have the Clock Proxy Server TZ location, either from the Clock or your broker.
     Type this location name, exactly as it appears in the Clock, into the Preface input called
     "Clock_Proxy_Server_Tz_Location".  Now change "Clock_Normal_vs_Find_Server_Tz" back to
     "true" for normal operation.  You have successfully completed the steps to assure the
     correct and 24/7 display of PivotsTz and market vLines.  This indicator adjusts for DST
     changeovers when they occur twice yearly, which happens at different times at different
     places.  This is fully automated.  No adjustments for DST are required by the user.

     The default "Clock_Proxy_Server_Tz_Location" is "Helsinki" because it is the most popular
     time zone used for broker servers.  If this is not the time zone your broker server uses,
     then PivotsTz and vLines will display incorrectly.  So, be sure you follow the steps
     above to confirm this default selection is correct, and if nowtwrtt then to find and input
     the correct Clock Proxy Server TZ location.  Without an input this indicator will not
     function.  Be sure that "Clock_Normal_vs_Find_Server" is "false" only when searching for
